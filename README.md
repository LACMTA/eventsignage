# Metro Signage Server
#### July 2016 | Douglas Goodwin

There are three parts to this application:

1. XML export from Outlook
2. Python XML parser and JSON emitter
3. JSON API and Websocket server

![overview](./systemdiagram.png)

#### Part 1 publishes current meetings scheduled in Outlook as an XML feed.
#### Part 2 GETs the XML, parses and converts it to JSON then POSTs the JSON to Part 3.
#### Part 3 parses the JSON and pushes content to the clients over websockets.
